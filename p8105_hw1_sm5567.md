# Section 1

- The variables in this dataset: 15 variables including origin, year,
  month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_qust,
  precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour.

- This dataset has 358 entries.

- The dataset has 15 rows and 358 columns.

- The mean of temperature is 39.58212 F.

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

- Image of a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points
  using the humid variable. This scatterplot is created with points
  colored according to the humid variable. The points are colored using
  a continuous scale, with the lower values of humid in dark blue and
  the higher values in skyblue. This makes it easy to see the
  relationship between the temp and humid variables.
- In this particular case, we can see that the temp tends to increase as
  the humid increases.

# Section 2

- Data frame comprised of:

``` r
samp = rnorm(10)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r
s2_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red", "green", "blue","red", "green", "blue", "red","green","blue", "red"))
)
```

``` r
library(tidyverse)
mean_samp = pull(s2_df, samp)
mean_vec_logical = pull(s2_df, vec_logical)
mean_vec_char = pull(s2_df, vec_char)
mean_vec_factor = pull(s2_df, vec_factor)
```

- mean_samp \[1\] 0.5029624 1.1513676 -0.2801048 -0.3766674 -0.5346995
  1.1083754 1.9419260 \[8\] -0.8730912 -0.2101289 -1.0619684

  - Calculating the mean of the numeric vector (mean_numeric) works fine
    because it contains numeric values

- mean_vec_logical \[1\] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE
  FALSE FALSE

  - Calculating the mean of the logical vector (mean_logical) also
    works, as R can treat TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so it calculates the
    mean correctly.

- mean_vec_char \[1\] “a” “b” “c” “d” “e” “f” “g” “h” “i” “j”

- mean_vec_factor \[1\] red green blue red green blue red green blue
  red  
  Levels: blue green red

  - However, attempting to calculate the mean of the character vector
    (mean_character) and the factor vector (mean_factor) results in an
    error because you cannot calculate the mean of non-numeric or factor
    variables directly.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(s2_df, samp))
```

    ##  [1] -1.10264509 -0.23437736 -0.56820457 -0.29743060  1.50477738  1.92089328
    ##  [7]  0.09247585 -0.80316683  0.75228956  0.41008815

``` r
as.numeric(pull(s2_df, vec_logical))
```

    ##  [1] 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1

``` r
as.numeric(pull(s2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(s2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ##  [1] 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3

- “NAs introduced by coercion” happened because R is trying to convert
  non-numeric values (characters) to a numeric data type using the
  as.numeric function.
- Other codes worked because they have numeric values.
- In summary, whether it makes sense to calculate the mean depends on
  what your data represents. For “yes” or “no” data, it works. For
  words, it doesn’t make sense. For categories, you can do it, but the
  result might not mean anything useful.
