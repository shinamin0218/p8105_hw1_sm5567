# Section 2

- Data frame comprised of:

``` r
samp = rnorm(10)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 10

``` r
s2_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red", "green", "blue","red", "green", "blue", "red","green","blue", "red"))
)
```

``` r
library(tidyverse)
mean_samp = pull(s2_df, samp)
mean_vec_logical = pull(s2_df, vec_logical)
mean_vec_char = pull(s2_df, vec_char)
mean_vec_factor = pull(s2_df, vec_factor)
```

- Calculating the mean of the numeric vector (mean_numeric) works fine
  because it contains numeric values.
- Calculating the mean of the logical vector (mean_logical) also works,
  as R can treat TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0, so it calculates the mean
  correctly.
- However, attempting to calculate the mean of the character vector
  (mean_character) and the factor vector (mean_factor) results in an
  error because you cannot calculate the mean of non-numeric or factor
  variables directly.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(s2_df, samp))

``` r

    ##  [1] 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3

- “NAs introduced by coercion” happened because R is trying to convert
  non-numeric values (characters) to a numeric data type using the
  as.numeric function.
- Other codes worked because they have numeric values.
